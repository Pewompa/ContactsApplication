# Contacts Application
Basic 'contacts' website that I need to built as part of a bootcamp's entry assignment.
Here are the requirements:

Build a simple address book application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery. 

Itâ€™s a page that opens in the browser and looks like an address book you would find in a cell phone.


Requirements:
 
- Each contact should have a name, surname, phone number, and address.
 
- The data does not need to persist when the browser page is closed.
 
- The user needs to be able to create new contacts and delete contacts.
 
- There needs to be a search bar where the user can find existing contacts.

- Your CSS needs to be clean.
