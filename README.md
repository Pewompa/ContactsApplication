# ContactsApplication
Basic 'contacts' website that I need to built as part of a bootcamp's entry assignment.
Here are the requirements:

Build a simple address book application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery. 

It’s a page that opens in the browser and looks like an address book you would find in a cell phone.

Requirements
 
Each contact should have a name, surname, phone number, and address.
 
The data does not need to persist when the browser page is closed.
 
The user needs to be able to create new contacts and delete contacts.
 
There needs to be a search bar where the user can find existing contacts.


 
Your CSS needs to be clean.
 
Use 3 separate files: one for CSS, one for HTML, and one for JavaScript and jQuery.
 
If your submission contains multiple lines of code taken from any online sources (like code snippets, articles, tutorials, etc.) add a comment citing that work. Copying code without attribution will disqualify you.
 
If you don’t have previous experience with the following technologies, complete these tutorials before starting to work on your assignment.
 

HTML

CSS

Chrome DevTools (only the “CSS”, “DOM”, and “JavaScript” sections)

jQuery
